does the video incite "extreme rhetoric" at all?

what is the nature of the incitement?
    - repetition of what is being said?
    - simplism (e.g. count num adverbs)
    - annotations?

does incitement happen at different rates for different users?
    - frequent vs infrequent users?
    - part vs not part of "communities"?
        - commenting on similar style (semantically embedded)
        - replies (socially embedded)
